## Branching Structure

To ensure an organized development workflow, all developers are required to follow the branching structure below:

### Branch Naming Convention
- **`main`**: This is the stable branch containing production-ready code. Direct commits to this branch are prohibited.
- **`develop`**: This branch contains the latest merged features for staging or testing. It serves as the main integration branch.
- **Feature Branches**:
  - Use the following naming convention for feature branches:
    ```
    feature/<developer-name>/<feature-name>
    ```
    Example: `feature/john/add-login-page`
- **Bugfix Branches**:
  - Use the following naming convention for bug fixes:
    ```
    bugfix/<developer-name>/<bug-description>
    ```
    Example: `bugfix/jane/fix-navbar-layout`
- **Hotfix Branches**:
  - Use the following naming convention for urgent production fixes:
    ```
    hotfix/<developer-name>/<fix-description>
    ```
    Example: `hotfix/alex/fix-critical-login-error`

### Workflow
1. Create a new branch from `develop` for your feature or bug fix.
2. Commit your changes to the branch.
3. Push the branch to the remote repository.
4. Create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into `develop`.
5. Wait for code reviews and approvals before merging.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Please ensure you:
1. Follow the branching structure guidelines mentioned above.
2. Test your changes thoroughly before creating a pull request.
3. Add comments and documentation where necessary.

### Code Style
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Use meaningful commit messages.

## Project Setup

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to define environment-specific variables. Refer to `.env.example` for required variables.

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building the Project
```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready build will be generated in the `build` directory.

## Scripts

Here are the available npm scripts:

- **`npm start`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm test`**: Runs tests.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the codebase.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript.
- **Redux**: State management.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing.
